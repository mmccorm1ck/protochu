## Protochu

## This project is a work in progress 

A discord bot that can join in-progress pokemon showdown games and record the results.
Can also analyse replays in the same way.

Built using node.js and discord.js

Inspiration taken from [Porygon](https://github.com/PorygonBot/bot-js) and Quinella and TalkTakesTime's [Chat Bot](https://github.com/TalkTakesTime/Pokemon-Showdown-Bot)
